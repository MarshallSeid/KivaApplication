// At each loan - look at the country, go to the country's hash map 
// Phillipines, # 
// US, # -> 

// End up with the information on each country, on each category, amounts

// User inputs their category, country, and amount. Depending on how close it is to the funded
// Vs how close to the unfunded figures, we return them a % -> probabliity of getting funded
// If percentage is lower than 66%, show the factors that are much closer to the nonfunded averages
// and give recommendation to user. 

// Create prototype, that takes in those inputs. And returns the average
